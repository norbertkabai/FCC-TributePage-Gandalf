      <li><h2>Who is Gandalf?</h2>
      <p>Gandalf the Grey is an <strong>Istar</strong> (Wizard), sent to Middle-earth by the <strong>Valar</strong>, to combat Sauron. He was sent in the Third Age, along with <strong>Saruman the White</strong>, <strong>Radagast the Brown</strong>, and 2 blue wizards, whose names have been lost. He joined <strong>Thorin Oakshield</strong>s company, to help him reclaim his homeland, the Lonely Mountains from the dragon named Smaug. After achieving that, he spent his time wandering, and obtaining information about the <strong>One Ring</strong>. Eventually he arrived to the Shire, to visit his old friend from the above mentioned company, <strong>Bilbo Baggins</strong>. Gandalf also helped to form and was part of the <strong>Fellowship of the Ring</strong>, saved the Fellowship from a Balrog at the cost of his own life, then he was sent back by <strong>Eru</strong> and became Gandalf the White. He fought alongside the people of Rohan at <strong>Helm's Deep</strong>, took part in the battle of <strong>Gondor</strong>, and led the Free Peoples against Sauron in the <strong>War of the Ring</strong>, where they emerged victorious.</p></li>
